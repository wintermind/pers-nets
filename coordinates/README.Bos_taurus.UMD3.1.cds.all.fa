IMPORTANT: Please note you can download correlation data tables,
supported by Ensembl, via the highly customisable BioMart and
EnsMart data mining tools. See http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview or

##################
Fasta cds dumps
#################

These files hold the coding sequences corresponding to Ensembl gene 
predictions. CDS does not contain UTR or intronic sequence.

------------
FILE NAMES
------------
The files are consistently named following this pattern:
<species>.<assembly>.<sequence type>.<status>.fa.gz

<species>: The systematic name of the species.
<assembly>: The assembly build name.
<sequence type>: cds for CDS sequences
<status>
  * 'cds.all' - the super-set of all transcripts coding sequences resulting from
     Ensembl known, novel and pseudo gene predictions (see more below).

EXAMPLES  (Note: Most species do not have sequences for each different <status>)
  for Human:
    Homo_sapiens.NCBI37.cds.all.fa.gz
      cds sequences for all transcripts: known, novel and pseudo

Difference between known and novel transcripts
-----------------------------------------------
Transcript or protein models that can be mapped to species-specific entries
in Swiss-Prot, RefSeq or SPTrEMBL are referred to as known genes in Ensembl.
Those that cannot be mapped are called novel genes (e.g. genes predicted on
the basis of evidence from closely related species).

For models annotated by HAVANA the status is set manually. Models that have 
an HGNC name are referred to as known and the remaining models are referred to
as novel.

-------------------------------
FASTA Sequence Header Lines
------------------------------
The FASTA sequence header lines are designed to be consistent across
all types of Ensembl FASTA sequences.  This gives enough information
for the sequence to be identified outside the context of the FASTA file.

General format:

>ID SEQTYPE:STATUS LOCATION GENE

Example of an Ensembl CDS header:
